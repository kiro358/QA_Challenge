# TheScore Android App Testing

## Task Description
This task involves conducting end-to-end automated testing of theScore mobile application using the Appium framework. The goal is to simulate user interactions within the app to validate and ensure the seamless functionality and integration of its features from a user's perspective. This encompasses navigating through different parts of the app, executing specific actions, and verifying the correct behaviour and output at each step.

### Key Components of the Task:
- **Setup and Configuration:**
  - Install and configure all necessary tools and environments, including Appium, an appropriate IDE, and the mobile device or emulator.
  - Set up theScore app on the testing device or emulator to ensure it is ready for automation.

- **Test Scenario Implementation:**
  - Automate the navigation to different sections such as leagues, teams, and players.
  - Interact with various UI elements like buttons, lists, and text fields to simulate user actions.
  - Validate the functionality of sub-tabs like league tables, standings, leaders, or player stats and ensure the data corresponds accurately to the selected context.

- **Validation and Verification:**
  - Implement assertions to check that the app displays the correct information and navigates to the expected pages after each action.
  - Ensure that the back navigation functionality returns to the previous page accurately, maintaining the app's state consistency.

- **Error Handling and Reporting:**
  - Incorporate robust error handling to manage unexpected app behaviour or interruptions during the test execution.
